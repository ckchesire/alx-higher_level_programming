# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance 
In object-oriented programming, a superclass (or base class) is the parent class from which a subclass inherits attributes and methods. Inheritance allows code reuse, extensibility, and polymorphism, enabling subclasses to override or extend functionality. New attributes can be added dynamically to instances, and you can list all attributes and methods using `dir()`. Python supports multiple inheritance, with the `object` class as the default base class. The built-in functions `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `type()`, and `super()` help in type checking and method inheritance management.
