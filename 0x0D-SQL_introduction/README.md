# 0x0D. SQL - Introduction

A database is an organized collection of data, while a relational database 
stores data in tables with relationships managed through keys. SQL (Structured
 Query Language) is used to interact with databases, and MySQL is a popular 
open-source relational database management system. Key SQL commands include 
`CREATE` and `ALTER` for defining tables (DDL), and `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, 
`DELETE`, and `SELECT` for managing data (DML). Subqueries allow nested queries
 for complex operations, and MySQL functions, like aggregate (`MAX`, `COUNT`) 
or string and date functions, enhance data manipulation. To create a database 
in MySQL, use `CREATE DATABASE`, and similar structured commands manage tables
and data.
