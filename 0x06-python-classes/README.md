# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects 
- Python is an awesome programming language due to its simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries, making it ideal for a wide range of applications. It supports **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, which organizes code into **classes** (blueprints) and **objects** (instances).
- **Attributes** hold data, while **methods** define behavior, with special methods like `__init__` acting as constructors.
- Python's **self** keyword refers to the instance, and attributes can be **public**, **protected**, or **private** to control access. 
- **Encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **information hiding** help structure programs by controlling data visibility. 
- Python encourages using **properties** with the `@property` decorator for clean **getter** and **setter** methods.
- Dynamic features include adding new attributes at runtime and accessing attributes through methods like **getattr**. The **__dict__** attribute stores an object's namespace, while Python's **method resolution order (MRO)** determines how it finds attributes.
