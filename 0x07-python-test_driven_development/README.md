# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development 
- An interactive test is where the user interacts with the program to manually
check its functionality. Instead of running automated tests, you input values or
follow a process to verify how software behaves.

Tests are important because they:
- Ensure code quality
- Prevent Regressions
- Facilitate Maintenance
- Enhance Collaboration

Docstrings, are comments within functions, classes, or modules that describe what
the code does.When used in testing, especially with a tool like doctest, they can
serve as both documentation and tests
