# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output 

File handling can be done through the open() function, enabling reading, writing, and managing file operations, 
with the with statement ensuring files are properly closed. You can read a file's content all at once or line 
by line, and the seek() method lets you move the file cursor. JSON, a widely-used data format, facilitates 
data exchange. Serialization converts Python objects to formats like JSON, while deserialization converts them 
back. Using the json module, Python objects can easily be converted to and from JSON strings.
