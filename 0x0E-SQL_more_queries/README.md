# 0x0E. SQL - More queries

To create a new MySQL user, use `CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY
'password';` and manage their privileges with `GRANT` or `REVOKE` statements.
A **PRIMARY KEY** uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a **FOREIGN 
KEY** establishes relationships between tables. Use **NOT NULL** to prevent 
null values and **UNIQUE** to enforce unique column values. Retrieve data 
from multiple tables using **JOIN** (e.g., combining rows based on related 
columns) or **UNION** (merging results from multiple queries). Subqueries are
nested queries used for calculations or filtering. These tools facilitate 
effective database design, user management, and data retrieval.
