# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

JavaScript is an incredibly versatile programming language widely used for creating
dynamic and interactive web applications. It enables developers to work seamlessly
on both the client-side and server-side of applications. 

JavaScript objects can be created using various methods, such as object literals, 
constructors, and the `Object.create()` method, allowing flexibility in how data and 
behavior are modeled. 

The `this` keyword dynamically refers to the object executing the code, while 
`undefined` indicates variables that are declared but not yet assigned values. 
Closures, a powerful feature of JavaScript, allow functions to retain access to their 
outer scope even after the outer function has returned, facilitating encapsulation 
and state management.

JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance allows objects to share methods and properties
efficiently, making it an essential concept for creating reusable code. Developers
can inherit objects using `Object.create()` or prototypes, extending functionalities 
while maintaining a clean architecture. Understanding variable types (`var`, `let`, 
`const`) and scope (global, local, or block) is crucial for avoiding bugs and writing 
maintainable code.
