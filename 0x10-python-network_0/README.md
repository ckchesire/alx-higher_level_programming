# 0x10. Python - Network 

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web address used to access resources online,
composed of components like the scheme (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS), domain name, port, path,
query string, and fragment. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) facilitates data transfer
between clients (browsers) and servers through requests and responses, with metadata in
headers and data in the message body. HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) specify actions,
and status codes (e.g., 200, 404) indicate results. Sub-domains (e.g., blog.google.com)
and cookies store additional information for sessions and preferences. A query string
passes data in key-value pairs, and cURL is a tool for making HTTP requests from the
command line. Typing a URL in a browser initiates DNS resolution, establishes a TCP
connection, sends an HTTP request, and renders the server's response into a webpage.
