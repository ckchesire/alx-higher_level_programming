# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm where classes act as blueprints for creating objects (or instances), encapsulating attributes (data) and methods (behavior). Objects are specific instances of classes, and attributes can be public, protected, or private to control access. The `self` keyword refers to the current instance, and `__init__` initializes an object's attributes. Data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding help manage complexity by restricting access. Properties, created with `@property`, offer a cleaner way to manage attribute access, while `__str__` and `__repr__` methods define user-friendly and developer-friendly string representations, respectively. Class attributes are shared across instances, while object attributes are unique to each instance. Methods can be instance-specific, class methods (`@classmethod`), or static methods (`@staticmethod`). Python allows dynamic attribute creation, and the `__dict__` attribute stores an object's attributes. The `getattr()` function accesses attributes dynamically, while Python follows a Method Resolution Order (MRO) to find attributes in objects and classes.
